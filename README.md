![Tests](https://github.com/sanjP10/release-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

This is an action that enables the use of the tool [release](https://github.com/sanjP10/release) in a GitHub action.
This exposes the use of the tool with a GitHub action interface.

Release is a tool that validates and creates tags against git repos by reading your changelog file. 
It requires a markdown formatted changelog, with the most recent changes at the top. 
The that consists of a version must start with a `h2` markup and have a number afterward.

An example changelog would be

```
# Changelog

[//]: <> (Spaces an no spaces on version number lines are for checking regex in unit tests)
## 1.1.0

### Updated
* An update happened

## 1.0.0

### Added

* Initial release

```

the version numbers can be of a format with decimals separating them.

Example formats tha can be used are

```
major
major.minor
major.minor.patch
major.minor.patch.micro
```
***Note: the format must be consistent within the changelog***

    # Notes

    If you are intending on creating workflows that are based on the [release event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#release).
    You need to use a token that is not the [github.token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context) variable.
    This needs to be a Personal Access Token(PAT) that is associated to a user, which is also where [github.actor](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context) is used by default as the user may need to be charged to a static user associated with the PAT if the repository is shared across multiple users.
